# 2iCode - 
#Hi, I have completed the task.
 
#I have created simple .java file with main method. In the same class, I am calling the required function.
#I could have created the different class and call the function from that class also, but I am assuming purpose of this task is just to #verify the logic hence, I have used single class.
#2ndly, in your EXAMPLEs, output of 3rd example looks incorrect to me. Output should be 3, whereas its showing 2 on example provided.
